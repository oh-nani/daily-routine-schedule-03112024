        <span class="notes-text-bullet">Flexibility Is Key:</span> You might
        find that some mornings are more rushed than others, or you may need to
        adjust your workout length. Being flexible and forgiving with yourself
        is important as you establish this new routine.<br />
        <span class="notes-text-bullet">Listening to Your Body:</span> On days
        when you're not feeling up to a full workout, consider a lighter
        activity like stretching or a gentle yoga session to keep the habit
        without overexerting yourself.<br /><br />
        Adjusting your morning to include a workout might mean you have to be
        more efficient with your time, but it can significantly enhance your
        overall well-being and energy levels.
